# .Net-Core-2.2
Sample Implementation of .Net Core 2.2 Web API, Razor MVC, JQueryUI, EntityFramework 6.
Developed using Visual Studio 2017 and SQL Server 2016.

# Build Solution (In Visual Studio)

Make sure that both the API and Razor projects are set as start up projects.
To do this, right-click the solution file and select Set Startup Projects.
Select Multiple startup projects radio button.
Set the Action for API and Razor projects as Start or Start without debugging.

Note: I'll improve this whenever I have time. ;)

Happy coding!
